Hello!
Hello, in this video I'll show you how to install and use the program.
First of all, copy the github repository
		git clone https://github.com/Mozheykin/clone_signal.git

MT4 expert in (clone_signal.ex4, clone_signal.mq4) MQL4/Experts/

All other files are transferred to the folder MQL4/Files/
To run, install the dependencies with the command
			pip install requirements.txt -r

Authorize your telegram
		https://my.telegram.org/apps

enter your data in the configuration file
	We introduce them instead of env.api_id

	for example

		api_id = 123123123
		api_hash = '1233123hfd34jdmnvncc21'
		This is how they look
		save

We find out the necessary channel in order to receive signals from it.

copy the channel number and since it is private, add -100 in front of the number
-1001621419348


next start programm, go in terminal, go dirrectory programm, and use command:
		python3 clone_signal.py

Programm start.

Next go Metatrader4, and start expert.

4) Change order SL good
